title = {Revisiting cosmic ray antinuclei fluxes with a new coalescence model},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Antideuteron and antihelium nuclei have been proposed as promising detection   channels for dark matter because of the low astrophysical backgrounds   expected. To estimate both potential exotic contributions and their   backgrounds, one usually employs the coalescence model in momentum   space. Here we use instead a newly developed coalescence model based on   the Wigner function representations of the produced nuclei states. This   approach includes both the process-dependent size of the formation region of   antinuclei, and the momentum correlations of coalescing antinucleons in a   semi-classical picture. The model contains a single universal parameter   σ that we tune to experimental data on antideuteron production in   electron-positron, proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. The obtained   value σ≃ 1 fm agrees well with its physical interpretation   as the size of the formation region of antinuclei in collisions of   point-like particles. This model allows us therefore to calculate in a   consistent frame-work the antideuteron and antihelium fluxes both from   secondary production and from dark matter annihilations. We find that the   antihelium-3 flux falls short by more than an order of magnitude   of the detection sensitivity of the AMS-02 experiment, assuming standard   cosmic ray propagation parameters, while the antideuteron flux can be   comparable to the sensitivities of the AMS-02 and GAPS experiments.}

title = {Prospects of detecting dark matter through cosmic-ray antihelium with the antiproton constraints},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Cosmic-ray (CR) antihelium is  an important observable for dark matter (DM) indirect searches  due to  extremely low secondary backgrounds towards low energies. In a given DM model, the predicted  CR antihelium flux is expected to be strongly  correlated  with that of CR antiprotons.  In this work, we use the AMS-02 p̄/p data to constrain the DM annihilation cross section, and the ALICE data on the 3H̄ē and T̄ productions   to determine the  parameters in the coalescence model  for anti-nucleus formation. The hadronic cross sections are estimated using Monte-Carlo event generators including EPOS-LHC and DPMJET. Based on these constraints, we make predictions for the maximal antihelium flux for typical  DM annihilation final states, and perform a detailed analysis on  the uncertainties due to  the DM density profiles and CR propagation models. We find that the  results are  highly insensitive to both of them, but still significantly depend on the  hadronization models in event generators. The prospects of detecting antihelium for the AMS-02 experiment is discussed. We show that with very optimistic assumptions, CR 3H̄ē is within the reach  of the AMS-02 experiment. The 3H̄ē events which can be detected by AMS-02  are likely to have kinetic energy  T ≳ 30 GeV, which is consistent with the preliminary AMS-02 search results. The events which can be observed by AMS-02 are likely to arise dominantly from secondary backgrounds rather than DM interactions.}

abstract = {The Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey (GRAMS) is a next-generation balloon/satellite mission utilizing a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector to measure both MeV gamma rays and antinuclei produced by dark matter annihilation or decay. The GRAMS can identify antihelium-3 events based on the measurements of X-rays and charged pions from the decay of the exotic atoms, Time of Flight (TOF), energy deposition, and stopping range. This paper shows the antihelium-3 sensitivity estimation using a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation. For the proposed long-duration balloon (LDB) flight program (35 days × 3 flights) and future satellite mission (2-year observation/10-year observation), the sensitivities become 1.47 × 10−7 [m2 s sr GeV/n]−1 and 1.55 × 10−9 [m2 s sr GeV/n]−1/3.10×10−10 [m2 s sr GeV/n]−1, respectively. The results indicate that GRAMS can extensively investigate various dark matter models through the antihelium-3 measurements.}

abstract = {{This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (ℓ ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ∗ = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10-2, Ωbh2 = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, Ωch2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ΛCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter ΛCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ ℓ ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an “anomaly” in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.}},

The stellar and gaseous discs provide virtually equal contributions to the galaxy gravitational potential at large galactocentric radii, but no obvious correlation is found between the radial distribution of dark matter and the distribution of stars or gas. Results of the best fit to the mass distribution in M33 picture a dark halo which controls the gravitational potential from 3 kpc outward, with a matter density which decreases radially as R−1.3. The density profile is consistent with the theoretical predictions for structure formation in hierarchical clustering cold dark matter (CDM) models, and favours lower mass concentrations than those expected in the standard cosmogony.}},

abstract = {Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.}

abstract = {A series of Balloon-borne Experiments with a Superconducting Spectrometer, BESS, has been made since 1993. We report here the absolute cosmic-ray proton and helium spectra in energy ranges of 1 to 120 GeV and 1 to 54 GeV / nucleon, respectively, as measured by the 1998 balloon flight of the BESS spectrometer. Those spectra were determined within overall uncertainties of ±5 % for protons and ±10 % for helium nuclei including statistical and systematic errors. The covered energy range is relevant to the atmospheric neutrinos observed as “fully contained events” in Super-Kamiokande. In order to extend the energy range up to around 1 TeV, we have started to design and develop new tracking detectors. Those energy spectra in a higher energy region will help to estimate the interstellar spectra of primary cosmic rays and the absolute fluxes of “up-going muons.”}

title = {Cosmic-ray antinuclei as messengers of new physics: status and outlook for the new decade},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {The precise measurement of cosmic-ray antinuclei serves as an important means for identifying the nature of dark matter and other new astrophysical phenomena, and could be used with other cosmic-ray species to understand cosmic-ray production and propagation in the Galaxy. For instance, low-energy antideuterons would provide a “smoking gun” signature of dark matter annihilation or decay, essentially free of astrophysical background. Studies in recent years have emphasized that models for cosmic-ray antideuterons must be considered together with the abundant cosmic antiprotons and any potential observation of antihelium. Therefore, a second dedicated Antideuteron Workshop was organized at UCLA in March 2019, bringing together a community of theorists and experimentalists to review the status of current observations of cosmic-ray antinuclei, the theoretical work towards understanding these signatures, and the potential of upcoming measurements to illuminate ongoing controversies. This review aims to synthesize this recent work and present implications for the upcoming decade of antinuclei observations and searches. This includes discussion of a possible dark matter signature in the AMS-02 antiproton spectrum, the most recent limits from BESS Polar-II on the cosmic antideuteron flux, and reports of candidate antihelium events by AMS-02; recent collider and cosmic-ray measurements relevant for antinuclei production models; the state of cosmic-ray transport models in light of AMS-02 and Voyager data; and the prospects for upcoming experiments, such as GAPS. This provides a roadmap for progress on cosmic antinuclei signatures of dark matter in the coming years.}

The recent publication of the first upper limit on the low energy antideuteron flux by the BESS Collaboration, a new evaluation of the standard astrophysical background, and remarkable progress in the development of a dedicated experiment, GAPS, motivate a new and accurate analysis of the antideuteron flux expected in particle dark matter models. To this extent, we consider here supersymmetric, universal extra-dimensional (UED) Kaluza–Klein and warped extra-dimensional dark matter models, and assess both the prospects for antideuteron detection and the various related sources of uncertainties. The GAPS experiment, even in a preliminary balloon-borne set-up, will explore many supersymmetric configurations, and, eventually, in its final space-borne configuration, will be sensitive to primary antideuterons over the whole cosmologically allowed UED parameter space, providing a search technique which is highly complementary with other direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {The search for cosmic antideuterons has been proposed as a promising method to indirectly detect dark matter, due to the very small background flux from spallations expected at the energies relevant to experiments. The antideuteron flux from dark matter annihilations or decays is, however, severely constrained by the non-observation of an excess in the antiproton-to-proton fraction measured by PAMELA. In this paper we calculate, for representative dark matter annihilation and decay channels, upper limits on the number of antideuteron events at AMS-02 and GAPS from requiring that the associated antiproton flux is in agreement with the PAMELA data. To this end, we first analyze in detail the formation of antideuterons in the coalescence model using an event-by-event Monte Carlo simulation and using data from various high energy experiments. We find that the resulting coalescence momentum shows a dependence on the underlying process and on the center of mass energy involved. Then, we calculate, using a diffusion model, the flux of antideuterons at the Earth from dark matter annihilations or decays. Our results indicate that, despite the various sources of uncertainty, the observation of an antideuteron flux at AMS-02 or GAPS from dark matter annihilations or decays will be challenging.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {The search for antideuterons in cosmic rays has been proposed as a promising channel for dark matter indirect detection, especially for dark matter particles with a low or intermediate mass. With the current operational phase of the AMS-02 experiment and the ongoing development of a future dedicated experiment, the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), there are exciting prospects for a dark matter detection in the near future.  In this paper we develop a detailed and complete re-analysis of the cosmic-ray antideuteron signal, by discussing the main relevant issues related to antideuteron production and propagation through the interstellar medium and the heliosphere.  In particular, we first critically revisit the coalescence mechanism for antideuteron production in dark matter annihilation processes.  Then, since antideuteron searches have their best prospects of detection at low kinetic energies where the effect of the solar wind and magnetic field are most relevant, we address the impact of solar modulation modeling on the antideuteron flux at the Earth by developing a full numerical 4D solution of cosmic rays transport in the heliosphere. We finally use these improved predictions to provide updated estimates of the reaching capabilities for AMS-02 and GAPS, compatible with the current constraints imposed by the antiprotons measurements of PAMELA. After the antiproton bound is applied, prospects of detection of up to about 15 events in GAPS LDB+ and AMS-02 missions are found, depending on the dark matter mass, annihilation rate and production channel from one side, and on the coalescence process, galactic and solar transport parameters on the other.}

	abstract = {Galactic Dark Matter (DM) annihilations can produce cosmic-ray anti-nuclei via the nuclear coalescence of the anti-protons and anti-neutrons originated directly from the annihilation process. Since anti-deuterons have been shown to offer a distinctive DM signal, with potentially good prospects for detection in large portions of the DM-particle parameter space, we explore here the production of heavier anti-nuclei, specifically anti-helium. Even more than for anti-deuterons, the DM-produced anti-He flux can be mostly prominent over the astrophysical anti-He background at low kinetic energies, typically below 3-5 GeV/n. However, the larger number of anti-nucleons involved in the formation process makes the anti-He flux extremely small. We therefore explore, for a few DM benchmark cases, whether the yield is sufficient to allow for anti-He detection in current-generation experiments, such as Ams-02. We account for the uncertainties due to the propagation in the Galaxy and to the uncertain details of the coalescence process, and we consider the constraints already imposed by anti-proton searches. We find that only for very optimistic configurations might it be possible to achieve detection with current generation detectors. We estimate that, in more realistic configurations, an increase in experimental sensitivity at low kinetic energies of about a factor of 500-1000 would allow to start probing DM through the rare cosmic anti-He production.},

The presence of anti-nuclei in cosmic rays has actually profound implications on the fundamental question of the baryon asymmetry of the universe. It is therefore crucial to determine the amount of anti-matter which our own galaxy already produces through the spallation of high-energy protons on the interstellar gas of the galactic disk. We have used here a coalescence model to assess the amount of anti-deuterium and anti-helium 3He present in cosmic rays together with anti-protons. The propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy is described through a two-zone diffusion model which correctly describes the observed abundances. We find that the Dp ratio exceeds 10−9 above a momentum per anti-nucleon of ∼ 4 GeV/c. Would the universe be purely made of matter, the AMS collaboration should be able to detect a few anti-deuterons during the space station stage of the experiment. However, the 3Hep abundance does not exceed ∼ 4 × 10−13. Heavier anti-nuclei are even further suppressed.}

Therefore, a detectable d¯ signal is compatible with the lack of an excess in the p¯ PAMELA flux.

GAPS captures these antideuterons into a target with the subsequent formation of exotic atoms. These exotic atoms decay with the emission of x-rays of precisely defined energy and a correlated pion signature from nuclear annihilation. This signature uniquely characterizes the antideuterons. Preliminary analysis of data from a prototype GAPS in an antiproton beam at the KEK accelerator in Japan has confirmed the multiple x-ray/pion star topology and indicated x-ray yields consistent with prior expectations. Moreover, our success in utilizing solid rather than gas targets represents a significant simplification over our original approach and offers potential gains in sensitivity through reduced dead mass in the target area.}

GAPS utilizes a distinctive detection method using atomic X-rays and charged particles from the exotic atom as well as the timing, stopping range and dE/dX energy deposit of the incoming particle, which provides excellent antideuteron identification. In anticipation of a future balloon experiment, an accelerator test was conducted in 2004 and 2005 at KEK, Japan, in order to prove the concept and to precisely measure the X-ray yields of antiprotonic exotic atoms formed with different target materials [1]. The X-ray yields of the exotic atoms with Al and S targets were obtained as ∼ 75%, which are higher than were previously assumed in [2]. A simple, but comprehensive cascade model has been developed not only to evaluate the measurement results but also to predict the X-ray yields of the exotic atoms formed with any materials in the GAPS instrument. The cascade model is extendable to any kind of exotic atom (any negatively charged cascading particles with any target materials), and it was compared and validated with other experimental data and cascade models for muonic and antiprotonic exotic atoms. The X-ray yields of the antideuteronic exotic atoms are predicted with a simple cascade model and the sensitivity for the GAPS antideuteron search was estimated for the proposed long duration balloon program [3], which suggests that GAPS has a strong potential to detect antideuterons as a dark matter signature. A GAPS prototype flight (pGAPS) was launched successfully from the JAXA/ISAS balloon facility in Hokkaido, Japan in summer 2012 [4], [5] and a proposed GAPS science flight is to fly from Antarctica in the austral summer of 2017–2018.}

The gaseous antiparticle spectrometer (GAPS) identifies antimatter through the characteristic X-rays emitted by antimatter when it forms exotic atoms in gases. The approach provides large area and field of view, and excellent background rejection capability. If the GAPS concept is successfully demonstrated, then it would be an ideal candidate for space-based, indirect dark matter searches. GAPS can detect antideuterons produced in neutralino annihilations. A modest GAPS experiment can detect the neutralino for all minimal SUSY models in which the neutralino mass is in the ∼50–350 GeV mass range. Underground searches, by contrast, are only sensitive to about 1/2 the SUSY parameter space in this mass range.}

The GAPS Si(Li) detectors will form the first large-area, relatively high-temperature Si(Li) detector system with sensitivity to X-rays to operate at high altitude. These 10 cm-diameter, 2.5 mm-thick, 4- or 8-strip detectors provide the active area, X-ray absorption efficiency, energy resolution, and particle tracking capability necessary for the GAPS exotic-atom particle identification technique. In this paper, the detector performance is validated on the bases of X-ray energy resolution and reconstruction of cosmic minimum ionizing particle (MIP) signals. We use the established noise model for semiconductor detectors to distinguish sources of noise due to the detector from those due to signal processing electronics. We demonstrate that detectors with either 4 strips or 8 strips can provide the required ≲4 keV (FWHM) X-ray energy resolution at flight temperatures of −35 to −45̂C, given the proper choice of signal processing electronics. Approximately 1000 8-strip detectors will be used for the first GAPS Antarctic balloon flight, scheduled for late 2021.}

Mass production of GAPS Si(Li) detectors has been performed to construct a large-volume silicon tracker for GAPS. We achieved the first success of the mass production of large-area Si(Li) detectors with a high (∼90%) yield rate. Valuable datasets related to detector fabrication, such as detector performance and manufacturing parameters, were recorded and collected during the mass production. This study analyzes the datasets using statistical methods with the aim of comprehensively examining the mass production and to gain valuable insight into the fabrication method. Sufficient uniformities of the performance parameters (leakage current and capacitance) between detectors and strips are found, demonstrating high-quality and stable mass production. We also search for correlations between detector performance and manufacturing parameters by using data-mining techniques. Conventional multivariate analysis (multiple regression analysis) and machine-learning techniques (regression tree analysis) are complementarily used, and it is found that the Li-drift process makes a significant contribution to the performance parameters of the finished detectors. Detailed investigation of the drift process is performed using environmental data, and physical interpretations are presented. Our results provide valuable insight into the fabrication methods for this kind of large-area Si(Li) detector, and encourages future projects that require large-volume silicon trackers.}

Temperatures, pressures, and reservoir weight were monitored, and thereby confirming that the system transfers heat up to several hundred watts by a passive two-phase flow.

abstract = {The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a balloon-borne experiment designed to perform low-energy cosmic-ray antinuclei measurements to search for indirect signatures of dark matter annihilation or decay. A wide range of well-motivated dark matter models predicts antinuclei fluxes about two orders of magnitude above the expected astrophysical background below 250 MeV/n. The study of this unexplored low-energy region allows GAPS to achieve an unprecedented sensitivity for antideuteron and antihelium nuclei fluxes. GAPS will collect high statistics of low-energy antiprotons, extending the measurement of the antiproton spectrum to the unexplored region below 100 MeV. The GAPS experiment will perform three long-duration balloon flights over Antarctica, the first of which is planned for the 2024/2025 Austral summer. The experimental apparatus consists of a Si(Li) tracker surrounded by a time-of-flight system made of plastic scintillator paddles. GAPS uses a novel identification technique based on the formation of an exotic atom and its de-excitation and decay. This contribution will first illustrate the scientific potential of the GAPS experiment and its impact on indirect dark matter searches. It will then describe the experimental apparatus and the detection technique exploited to identify antinuclei events. The expected sensitivity for antinuclei, based on detailed instrument simulations, will be then discussed. Finally, the status of payload integration and testing before the first flight will be summarized.}

This design, developed for the unique requirements of the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) experiment, has an overall diameter of 10 cm, with ∼9 cm of active area segmented into 8 readout strips, and an overall thickness of 2.5 mm, with ≳2.2 mm (≳90%) sensitive thickness. An energy resolution ≲4 keV full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for 20−100 keV X-rays is required at the operating temperature ∼−40°C, which is far above the liquid nitrogen temperatures conventionally used to achieve fine energy resolution. High-yield production is also required for GAPS, which consists of ≳1000 detectors. Our specially-developed Si crystal and custom methods of Li evaporation, diffusion and drifting allow for a thick, large-area and uniform sensitive layer. We find that retaining a thin undrifted layer on the p-side of the detector drastically reduces the leakage current, which is a dominant component of the energy resolution at these temperatures. A guard-ring structure and optimal etching of the detector surface are also confirmed to suppress the leakage current. We report on the mass production of these detectors that is ongoing now, and demonstrate it is capable of delivering a high yield of ∼90%.}

Two types of OHP routing, U-shaped and O-shaped, have been investigated. For the operation at low temperature, R410A was used as the working fluid. As the result of the investigation, we verified for the first time that both the meter-scale U-shaped and O-shaped OHPs can transfer heat under gravity in a wide temperature range between 20°C and -60°C. Generally, the O-shaped OHP showed better performance than the U-shaped OHP. Both OHP models showed good thermal conductance and a good amount of heat transport under the particular sets of conditions which meet the design requirements. In order to clarify the drive force to operate OHP to further improve the OHP design, the performance difference between the U-shaped and the O-shaped models has been interpreted in terms of the gravity effect and the pressure loss. }

To identify antiparticles with sufficient energy resolution, it is essential to cool the detectors to operating temperatures below −40°C. To provide such cooling, we developed a novel multi-loop capillary heat pipe (MCHP) which merges gravitational force, capillary force, and self-oscillating driving force to flow a refrigerant effectively in thin tubes. The MCHP is suitable to cool a number of widely distributed detectors with a minimum mass, minimum power consumption, and large thermal conductivity, compared to any other techniques such as traditional pumped circulating systems. Experimental results using a two-meter-scale full-size model verified that the MCHP can meet all the requirements. The unique MCHP technique can be applied to thermally controlling other large particle/nuclear instruments.}

It features an energy resolution of 4 keV FWHM in the 20–100 keV range with a 40 pF detector capacitance, to clearly distinguish X-rays from antiprotonic or antideuteronic exotic atoms.

abstract = {The balloon-borne experiment with a superconducting spectrometer (BESS) has performed cosmic-ray observations as a US–Japan cooperative space science program, and has provided fundamental data on cosmic rays to study elementary particle phenomena in the early Universe. The BESS experiment has measured the energy spectra of cosmic-ray antiprotons to investigate signatures of possible exotic origins such as dark matter candidates or primordial black holes, and searched for heavier antinuclei that might reach Earth from antimatter domains formed in the early Universe. The apex of the BESS program was reached with the Antarctic flight of BESS-Polar II, during the 2007–2008 Austral Summer, that obtained over 4.7billion cosmic-ray events from 24.5days of observation. The flight took place at the expected solar minimum, when the sensitivity of the low-energy antiproton measurements to a primary source is greatest. Here, we report the scientific results, focusing on the long-duration flights of BESS-Polar I (2004) and BESS-Polar II (2007–2008).}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {High-energy collisions of cosmic-ray nuclei with interstellar gas are believed to be the mechanism producing the majority of cosmic-ray antiprotons. Because of the kinematics of the process, they are created with a nonzero momentum; the characteristic spectral shape with a maximum at ~2 GeV and a sharp decrease toward lower energies makes antiprotons a unique probe of models for particle propagation in the Galaxy and modulation in the heliosphere. On the other hand, accurate calculation of the secondary antiproton flux provides a "background" for searches for exotic signals from the annihilation of supersymmetric particles and primordial black hole evaporation. Recently, new data with large statistics on both low- and high-energy antiproton fluxes have become available which allow such tests to be performed. We use our propagation code GALPROP to calculate interstellar cosmic-ray propagation for a variety of models. We show that there is no simple model capable of accurately describing the whole variety of data: boron/carbon and sub-iron/iron ratios, spectra of protons, helium, antiprotons, positrons, electrons, and diffuse γ-rays. We find that only a model with a break in the diffusion coefficient plus convection can reproduce measurements of cosmic-ray species, and the reproduction of primaries (p, He) can be further improved by introducing a break in the primary injection spectra. For our best-fit model we make predictions of proton and antiproton fluxes near the Earth for different modulation levels and magnetic polarity using a steady state drift model of propagation in the heliosphere.}

title = {Simulation of charge readout with segmented tiles in nEXO},
journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {nEXO is a proposed experiment to search for the   neutrino-less double beta decay (0νββ) of 136Xe in   a tonne-scale liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) . The nEXO   TPC will be equipped with charge collection tiles to form the anode.   In this work, the charge reconstruction performance of this anode   design is studied with a dedicated simulation package. A   multi-variate method and a deep neural network are developed to   distinguish simulated 0νββ signals from backgrounds   arising from trace levels of natural radioactivity in the detector   materials. These simulations indicate that the nEXO TPC with   charge-collection tiles shows promising capability to discriminate   the 0νββ signal from backgrounds. The estimated   half-life sensitivity for 0νββ decay is improved by   ∼20 (32)% with the multi-variate (deep neural network)   methods considered here, relative to the sensitivity estimated in   the nEXO pre-conceptual design report.}

title = {Increasing light collection efficiency of liquid argon detector for low mass WIMP search},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Liquid argon (LAr) is known as an excellent target material for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter direct-detection search experiment. In WIMP searches, distinguishing signal events from electronic recoil (ER) backgrounds is essential. The reduction of ER power using pulse shape discrimination (PSD) improves as light collection efficiency increases. However photosensors, which have to be operational in a cryogenic environment, have no high quantum efficiency (QE) at the 128 nm VUV scintillation light of argon. Therefore, a wavelength shifter, i.e. tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), is evaporated on the inner surface of the detector to convert VUV to visible light that can be detected by photosensors.

Thus, we constructed a well-controlled TPB evaporation system to ensure reproducibility and measured the amount of TPB on the surface using a quartz crystal microbalance. We obtained the world’s highest light yield (˜11.5 PE/keVee) by optimizing the amount of evaporated TPB. We describe our efforts to improve light collection efficiency.}

abstract = {The General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a novel approach for indirect dark matter searches that exploits cosmic antideuterons. The GAPS detection method involves capturing antiparticles into a target material with the subsequent formation of an excited exotic atom. The exotic atom decays with the emission of atomic X-rays and charged particles from nuclear annihilation, which uniquely identifies the captured antiparticle. We are currently developing the lithium-drifted silicon (Si(Li)) detector for the GAPS flight experiment. In this paper, we describe the diagnostic tests conducted on three prototype Si(Li) detectors and the noise model to characterize each detector. The GAPS prototype flight, preparatory for a long duration balloon flight from Antarctica in 2016–2017, is scheduled for launch from Japan in summer 2012.}

abstract = {We have developed a neural network model to perform event reconstruction of Compton telescopes. This model reconstructs events that consist of three or more interactions in a detector. It is essential for Compton telescopes to determine the time order of the gamma-ray interactions and whether the incident photon deposits all energy in a detector or it escapes from the detector. Our model simultaneously predicts these two essential factors using a multi-task neural network with three hidden layers of fully connected nodes. For verification, we have conducted numerical experiments using Monte Carlo simulation, assuming a large-area Compton telescope using liquid argon to measure gamma rays with energies up to 3.0MeV. The reconstruction model shows excellent performance of event reconstruction for multiple scattering events that consist of up to eight hits. The accuracies of hit order prediction are around 60% while those of escape flags are higher than 70% for up to eight-hit events of 4π isotropic photons. Compared with two other algorithms, a classical model and a physics-based probabilistic one, the present neural network method shows high performance in estimation accuracy particularly when the number of scattering is small, 3 or 4. Since simulation data easily optimize the network model, the model can be flexibly applied to a wide variety of Compton telescopes.}

abstract = {Aimed at progress in mega-electron volt (MeV) gamma-ray astronomy, which has not yet been well-explored, Compton telescope missions with a variety of detector concepts have been proposed so far. One of the key techniques for these future missions is an event reconstruction algorithm that is able to determine the scattering orders of multiple Compton scattering events and to identify events in which gamma rays escape from the detectors before they deposit all of their energies. We revisit previous event reconstruction methods and propose a modified algorithm based on a probabilistic method. First, we present a general formalism of the probabilistic model of Compton scattering describing physical interactions inside the detector and measurement processes. Then, we also introduce several approximations in the calculation of the probability functions for efficient computation. For validation, the developed algorithm has been applied to simulation data of a Compton telescope using a liquid argon time projection chamber, which is a new type of Compton telescope proposed for the GRAMS project. We have confirmed that it works successfully for up to 8-hit events, including correction of incoming gamma-ray energies for escape events. The proposed algorithm can be used for next-generation MeV gamma-ray missions featured by large-volume detectors, e.g., GRAMS.}

GAPS is optimized to detect low-energy antideuterons, as well as to provide unprecedented sensitivity to low-energy antiprotons and antihelium nuclei. The novel GAPS antiparticle detection technique, based on the formation, decay, and annihilation of exotic atoms, provides greater identification power for these low-energy antinuclei than previous magnetic spectrometer experiments. This work reports the sensitivity of GAPS to detect antihelium-3 nuclei, based on full instrument simulation, event reconstruction, and realistic atmospheric influence simulations. The report of antihelium nuclei candidate events by AMS-02 has generated considerable interest in antihelium nuclei as probes of dark matter and other beyond the Standard Model theories. GAPS is in a unique position to detect or set upper limits on the cosmic antihelium nuclei flux in an energy range that is essentially free of astrophysical background. In three 35-day long-duration balloon flights, GAPS will be sensitive to an antihelium flux on the level of 1.3−1.2+4.5·10−6 m-2sr-1s-1(GeV/n)-1 (95% confidence level) in the energy range of 0.11–0.3 GeV/n, opening a new window on rare cosmic physics.}

The mission is based on an advanced space-proven detector technology, with unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution, combined with polarimetric capability. Thanks to its performance in the MeV-GeV domain, substantially improving its predecessors, e-ASTROGAM will open a new window on the non-thermal Universe, making pioneering observations of the most powerful Galactic and extragalactic sources, elucidating the nature of their relativistic outflows and their effects on the surroundings. With a line sensitivity in the MeV energy range one to two orders of magnitude better than previous generation instruments, e-ASTROGAM will determine the origin of key isotopes fundamental for the understanding of supernova explosion and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. The mission will provide unique data of significant interest to a broad astronomical community, complementary to powerful observatories such as LIGO-Virgo-GEO600-KAGRA, SKA, ALMA, E-ELT, TMT, LSST, JWST, Athena, CTA, IceCube, KM3NeT, and the promise of eLISA.}},

The gaseous antiparticle spectrometer (GAPS) effects particle identification through the characteristic X-rays emitted by antiparticles when they form exotic atoms in gases. GAPS obtains particularly high grasp (effective area-solid angle product) at lower particle energies, where conventional schemes are most limited in their utility. The concept is simple and lightweight, so it can be readily employed on balloon- and space-based missions. An extremely powerful potential application of GAPS is a space-based search for the neutralino through the detection of a neutralino annihilation by-product—the antideuteron. Paradoxically, this space-based search for the neutralino is capable of achieving comparable sensitivity to as yet unrealized third-generation, underground dark matter experiments. And GAPS can obtain this performance in a very modest satellite experiment. GAPS can also provide superior performance in searches for primary antiprotons produced via neutralino annihilation and black hole evaporation and in probing subdominant contributions to the antiproton flux at low energies. In a deep space mission, GAPS will obtain higher sensitivity for a given weight and power than BGO calorimeters.}

The flight was a success and the stable flight operation of the GAPS detector concept was proven. During the flight about 106 charged particle triggers were recorded, extensive X-ray calibrations of the individual tracker modules were performed by using an onboard X-ray tube, and the background level of atmospheric and cosmic X-rays was measured. The behavior of the tracker performance as a function of temperature was investigated. The tracks of charged particle events were reconstructed and used to study the tracking resolution, the detection efficiency of the tracker, and coherent X-ray backgrounds. A timing calibration of the time-of-flight subsystem was performed to measure the particle velocity. The flux as a function of flight altitude and as a function of velocity was extracted taking into account systematic instrumental effects.

Proton and helium spectra probe the origin and propagation history of cosmic rays in the galaxy, and are essential to calculations of the expected spectra of cosmic-ray antiprotons, positrons, and electrons from interactions of primary cosmic-ray nuclei with the interstellar gas, and to calculations of atmospheric muons and neutrinos. We report absolute spectra at the top of the atmosphere for cosmic-ray protons in the kinetic energy range 0.2–160 GeV and helium nuclei in the range 0.15–80 GeV/nucleon. The corresponding magnetic-rigidity ranges are 0.6–160 GV for protons and 1.1–160 GV for helium. These spectra are compared to measurements from previous BESS flights and from ATIC-2, PAMELA, and AMS-02. We also report the ratio of the proton and helium fluxes from 1.1 to 160 GV and compare this to the ratios from PAMELA and AMS-02.}

abstract = {The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a novel approach for indirect dark matter searches that exploits cosmic antiparticles, especially antideuterons. The GAPS antideuteron measurement utilizes distinctive detection methods using atomic X-rays and charged particles from the decay of exotic atoms as well as the timing and stopping range of the incoming particle, which together provide excellent antideuteron identification. Prior to the future balloon experiment, an accelerator test and a prototype flight were successfully conducted in 2005 and 2012 respectively, in order to verify the GAPS detection concept. This paper describes how the sensitivity of GAPS to antideuterons was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation along with the atomic cascade model and the Intra-Nuclear Cascade model. The sensitivity for the GAPS antideuteron search obtained using this method is 2.0 ×10−6[m−2s−1sr−1(GeV/n)−1] for the proposed long duration balloon program (LDB, 35 days × 3 flights), indicating that GAPS has a strong potential to probe a wide variety of dark matter annihilation and decay models through antideuteron measurements. GAPS is proposed to fly from Antarctica in the austral summer of 2019–2020.}
